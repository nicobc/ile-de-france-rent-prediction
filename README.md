The directory src contains the scripts necessary to scrap and clean property ads data. Once the data have been scraped and cleaned, the notebooks (located in the root of the repo) "modeling" and "dataviz" contain the code I use to visualise and model the data.

Please link to this repo should you use some of my code :)
